# Accessibility Work for CodeStitch Menus

## Notes:

-   Modifying [CodeStitch 1530](https://codestitch.app/app/dashboard/stitches/1530/rendered).
-   Using the [W3C Disclosure Pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/)
-   Referencing the [Example Disclosure Navigation Menu with Top-Level Links](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation-hybrid/)
-   It may be worth creating an alternate option for dropdown menus with no top-level links using this Example Pattern from the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/disclosure/examples/disclosure-navigation/)
-   Addressing keyboard navigation problems with dropdowns
-   Other noted issues include:
    -   Needs a skip to main link at the beginning of the page
    -   Need labels for social icon links
    -   Needs a span with sr-only text for social icons (some screen readers won't read the label)
    -   May find other things as I look deeper...
