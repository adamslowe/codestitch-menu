# Accessibility Work for CodeStitch Menus
## Notes:  
- Using [CodeStitch 1530](https://codestitch.app/app/dashboard/stitches/1530/rendered) as a reference.
- Addressing keyboard navigation problems with dropdowns
- Other noted issues include:
    - Needs a skip to main link at the beginning of the page
    - Need labels for social icon links 
    - Needs a span with sr-only text for social icons (some screen readers won't read the label)
    - May find other things as I look deeper...
